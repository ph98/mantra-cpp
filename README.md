# AI Challenge 2019 C++ Client
## Setup instructions
### Ubuntu
It is recommended to use CLion (JetBtains)otherwise, follow the below instructions to build the client:

```cd``` to the directory you want to save and run the code
```
git clone https://github.com/SharifAIChallenge/AIC19-Client-Cpp
cd AIC19-Client-Cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# To run the output issue:
./client/client
```

algorithm we can think about it : 

### A* for move 

1. if else weighted graph .
2. Nerual Network 
3. CGA ( what is C ? ) 
4. HMM ( is checking... ) 



## functions we need by now : 
1. print the whole map (done)
2. move with A* - shortest path 
3. get dengerouse zone by point - from enemy's heros position
4. some scrip for auto pilot:)
